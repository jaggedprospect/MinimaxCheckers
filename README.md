# MinimaxCheckers

This is a fun checkers program with a simple GUI and two AI variations.

The program supports Human vs. Human play, as well as Human vs. CPU and CPU vs. CPU.

You can choose to play against a CPU player that implements either a minimax AI algorithm or a random algorithm. Obviously, the minimax AI is a more formidable opponent.
I won't go into detail about the minimax algorithm here, but you can check out the [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) to learn more!
The code used to implement the minimax algorithm in this program is largely based on source code provided by <b>hanli1</b>. You can find his project [here](https://github.com/hanli1/minimax-checkers).

<b>A Few Notes:</b>
- The GUI has no navigation features and provides limited feedback. This will be updated in the future! 
- The GUI "surrender" button is currently non-functional.
- Pertinent information will be displayed in the terminal output while the program is running. 

Download and modify the source code as you see fit. This is a fun program to mess around with, and the CPU plays pretty well!
